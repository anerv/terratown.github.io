Hi and welcome to our blog!

We are Sara and Ane. This is a space where we explore our interest in  data, visualisations, and digital technologies from a critical perspective. Our hope is that this will become a platform for learning and exchanging ideas and serve as an inspiration for interesting and fun ways to work with data.

Sara has an interdisciplinary education in the fields of Computer Science, Urban Studies and Humanities & Technology. She is especially interested in the intersection between technology, social sciences, and geography. Sara is a Technology Consultant & Lab Manager at [FabLab RUC](https://fablab.ruc.dk) where she works with interactive programming, IoT, environmental sensing, citizen science, guerrilla data collection and digital fabrication.

Ane has a background in GIS (geographical information science), geography, and urban planning, and is particularly interested in new ways of visualising spatial data and communicating geographical phenomena. She is inspired by critical and feminist cartographies, and hopes to finally get a handle on JavaScript in 2021...

We are located in the Copenhagen area, so you might encounter some local context or post in Danish here.

Feel free to reach out!
